I'm a manager of engineering managers at Autodesk. This website aims to serve as my managing toolkit \u2014 a bag of ideas, philosophies and templates that help me get up and running when setting up a team, or share concepts with a new manager. Some concepts are largely my own, some have come largely from others. Some a new ideas, some are tried and tested. There's a lot of gaps, but I'm hoping to keep adding, learning, and iterating.","title":"Home"},{"location":"blog/2022/2022-05-19-hello/","text":"This simple (and quite niche) wiki is something I've been wanting to build for a while. Like a lot of newly minted managers, I relied heavily on verbal guidance, as documentation on best practices was sparsely available. I wanted something better than that. I'm a fan of building playbooks for new processes: work through a hard problem while documenting the steps on the next run through just plug the gaps by the third pass it's pretty straightforward and you have a template in place! However, all good processes are flexible and adapt over time. They should change as your philosophies, your team, and the org definitely will. This is how I've been writing items for the toolkit. I intend to continue to update it based what I'm learning and who I'm working with. In that same spirit it should also be explicitly stated that the goal of the wiki isn't to be prescriptive for managers\u2014you'll have different philosophies, different team norms, different cultures, etc.\u2014it's a starting point for a conversation . If this doesn't make sense for your team, think about why it doesn't work and what you would do differently. My intention for this toolkit is for it to cover everything a manager should be thinking about. We've all got knowledge gaps so a toolkit like this can only be complete if we share and learn from others. This a public GitHub repo so anyone can submit pull requests to help flesh it out. Likewise you can fork the repository and build something for yourself or your team (the only request is that you keep it public, to share your ideas). See you in there!","title":"Hello!"},{"location":"blog/2022/2022-06-24-hiring-guide/","text":"Love or hate it, hiring is an integral part of a manager's role. As a new manager, my bosses never made a point to teach better hiring practices. In the past, I've pieced together company interview questions and rubrics interview plans, but I wanted to create a holistic guide. I wanted to outline the \u201cwhy's\u201d as well as the \u201chow's\u201d\u2014something I would\u2019ve found useful when I first became a manager. Here\u2019s the hiring guide . I recently completed a hiring bootcamp training, which has helped me reinvigorate my interest in hiring. This hiring guide pulls in a lot of practical advice from the multi-day training, as well as other things I've picked up along the way. I like the distinction between hiring and interviewing\u2014interviewing is only a subset of the hiring process. Successful hiring starts with taking a step back and asking yourself key questions about the role\u2014not just posting the same iOS/backend/web role all over again. Onboarding is also something I consider to be an integral part of the hiring process (don\u2019t hamstring new hires by not helping them integrate with the team). I\u2019ll be fleshing out these interviewing and onboarding guides in the future. It\u2019s still early days using it, but I\u2019ve found the alignment guide to have the right framing questions to make writing the job description, and building the interview plan, more accurate to what your team actually needs. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find ways to improve the guide as I learn more, but this is a strong foundation.","title":"Hiring Guide"},{"location":"wiki/","text":"Manager Toolkit What is it? The purpose of this toolkit is to codify my managerial experience, bundle helpful templates, share with other managers, and learn from those more experienced than myself. This toolkit should get a new manager up and running, or help when starting a new team or job. This toolkit is a living wiki. The content will grow and shift as I learn from others and I gain more experience. I'm not a perfect manager. I have knowledge gaps and blind spots. I have focused on growing in some areas and have neglected others and, as such, content will be patchy in some areas. Is this toolkit for you? I think this toolkit will work best for: Someone who has a specific knowledge gap they want to plug (e.g. How do I successfully guide career growth). New managers looking to not make the same mistakes others have. Anyone looking to create their own toolkit - just fork mine! Others who have advice to share. I'd love to learn from you. What's covered in this toolkit? The toolkit is broken down into three main categories, as inspired by Andrei Gridnev's blog post . People Management - hiring, career growth, performance feedback, culture, etc. Delivery Leadership - planning, assigning tasks, liaising with other teams and/or customers, status reporting, etc. Technical System Ownership - technical design, managing technical debt, security, monitoring and alerting, technology adoption, etc. The opinions I've put forth in this wiki are my own. In my reading, experience and understanding of how others work this is what I've taken away as useful and fitting within my management philosophy.","title":"Manager Toolkit"},{"location":"wiki/#manager-toolkit","text":"","title":"Manager Toolkit"},{"location":"wiki/#what-is-it","text":"The purpose of this toolkit is to codify my managerial experience, bundle helpful templates, share with other managers, and learn from those more experienced than myself.

The Career Check-in Framework is a process guide and template for running regular career conversations. This guide was written from the perspective of an engineering manager running this program with their direct reports, but ICs could also be the ones introducing this to their managers. This is a generic framework and can be adapted to other other disciplines, or changing company needs. Goals The check-in template aims to align manager and report expectations, both around a report's growth within the company, and long-term career goals. The framework is designed to provide a way for people to get clear feedback about where they stand, preventing surprises during yearly review cycles. The framework encourages building out both a concrete list of things people can do to grow, as well as a record of contributions and improvements to review during promo cycles. Finally, we want to encourage an openness to discussing career and life growth outside of Autodesk. It's an unspoken truth that most people won't spend their career at Autodesk. By bringing longer-term career goals to the open we can both help the reports grow in the areas they care about, and also have an understanding of when a report should seek growth opportunities outside of Autodesk. There are also some clear anti-goals to highlight. The aim of the check-in framework isn't to encourage people to game the ladder, create more work for managers, or encourage ICs to focus on things that don't help the company. Overview The check-in document divides the conversation into 4 sections: Goals - What skills/projects the report wants to be working on over an increasing length of time. Reality - Where are they today? Do they have skills we can leverage, are we holding them back? Planning - What are some mid-term projects they can complete, and how can we break them down into small, measurable tasks? What have you done so far? - A history log of what your report has worked on, to date. Why should I try this out? Value for the Manager This gives you insight to each reports' trajectory and plans. By understanding the reports' plans, managers can keep their reports happy (meaning less attrition). If reports want to try other platforms or learn drastically new skills, it can be tracked within the career check-in doc and broken down in to \"bite-sized\" pieces. This satisfies the report's desire to progress on the goal, while allowing the manager to balance the exploration with regular feature work. Value for the Report This framework calls for a dedicated block of time for managers and reports to have a focused discussion around career goals. This regular meeting is an opportunity to receive career advice and direction. It's a chance to speak openly about what they want, and where they want to be in the future, with the knowledge that their manager isn't there to judge, but to assist. Getting started General Guidance There are no \"wrong\" answers. The suggested check-in interval is 6-8 weeks. It is not on the manager to do preparation work ahead of time. It is on the direct report to drive the conversation It is on the manager to ask probing questions to get to the heart of career goals a report might have. It is on the manager to provide meaningful guidance to the direct report. Probe about career decisions to discern their real goal. e.g. \"I want to be a CTO\" from an IC doesn't highlight any understanding on what that role would entail, or why they're aiming there. Be realistic with the report. e.g. a 1 year goal of becoming an Architect might not be reasonable for a mid-level report. Within the 6-week tasks section, it is advised to create tasks with the report as an assignee, and include a due date. Then, during regular 1:1s, look at their Confluence task and ask for updates on the items that are approaching their due date. This is a powerful way of reinforcing their goals, and if they truly want to make time for them. Before your first career conversation Talk to your report about this program, highlighting the benefits to them. Take a look through the check-in-template to familiarise yourself with the layout and suggested responses. Create a check-in document using the check-in-example . Be sure to make it private so that only you and the report can see it. In a regular 1:1 share the new check-in document with them. Be sure to run through each section with them at a high level to check their understanding. Get your direct report to fill out the \"Goals\" and \"Reality\" sections before your first official career check-in. During the first check-in 1. Get your direct report to read over, and expand on, the \"Goals\" and \"Reality\" section together Are the goals reasonable? Is the self assessment (reality) accurate? Are there blind spots you can fill in? Do the goals and areas of focus aligned with the team's needs? If not, are there other areas of focus that align with both the individual and the team goals? 2. Fill in the \"Planning\" section together Starting with the 6 month section, think about their higher-level career goals and help rough out some projects they can work on. e.g. Own the technical documentation for an upcoming project From their 6 month goals, help break down some of these projects into some tasks that can be completed before your next check-in e.g. @Direct Report Have a draft technical spec ready for technical review by 29 Oct 2020 These tasks should be SMART Specific - Is this a specific task, or should it be broken down? Measurable - Can this task be evaluated as \"done\"? \"Write better specs\" is not measurable. \"Have 50% commitment on my draft technical spec\" is. Achievable - The tasks should be challenging, but achievable with the resources and skills they have. Relevant - Is this task something that will help the report with their goals, and will it helping the team and company in some way? Time-bound - Set a deadline. Help the report identify opportunities. 3. Encourage the report to keep their \"What have you done so far?\" section up to date. Adding thorough summaries here help you both out in a in a number of ways More context means it'll be easier to support your case during a review cycle More context and evidence means there's supporting documentation if you're to be put forward for a promotion Clear context here is free content for their resume when applying for a new job. 4. Schedule the next follow up! These should happen once every 6 weeks (or at least once per quarter) Between career check-ins Get the IC to keep notes under \"What have you done so far?\" Keep a tight feedback loop, you don't have to wait until the next career conversation to touch on these topics. As a suggestion, before starting your 1:1s, review their career check-in tasks. If there's time in the meeting, ask about the status of whichever career task that is due next. This is a powerful way of reinforcing their goals or identifying if they are still passionate about the work. Note: If the tasks a created within Confluence you can easily create a table to view everyone's career tasks, which makes the above much easier. At each future session Check in on the \"Goals\" and \"Reality\" sections, has anything changed? Check in on the \"Planning\", is this still the right approach? Check in on the \"What have you done so far?\", are the notes sufficient? Schedule the next conversation!","title":"Career Check-in Framework"},{"location":"wiki/people-management/career-growth/career-check-in-framework/#career-check-in-framework","text":"Quick links: Example of a completed check-in | Career check-in template","title":"Career Check-in Framework"},{"location":"wiki/people-management/career-growth/career-check-in-framework/#what-is-this","text":"The Career Check-in Framework is a process guide and template for running regular career conversations.

At this timeframe, we should be touching on your wider personal ambitions. It's a hard one to answer and might take a couple of check-ins to solidify. Some prompts to get you started are: where will you live; what will you be working on; if you have other passions besides programming would you want to be exploring them; what's your dream job? Reality What is currently holding you back from your goals? This could be something personal (e.g. lack of experience, burnout), process related (e.g. not involved in the spec-writing process), organisational related (e.g. role/teams are too rigid).

Recycling the same job descriptions and interview plans for all candidates may save time upfront, but doing so may end up costing more time if we're not sourcing the right candidates because we haven't aligned on the role's needs . Job description templates and interview plans get you started quickly, but they shouldn't be a substitute for thinking deeply about what you want out of the role. Even if it's \"just\" a back-fill, it's worthwhile to realign to your company's goals and make sure you're on the same page with your interviewers. Hiring for diversity is often seen as a \"nice to have\". Instead, diversity should be considered a core part of what good hiring looks like as it brings many benefits: diverse candidates bring varied experiences and ways of thinking, bringing fresh ideas and new solutions; different cultural values keep a company open-minded and accepting; diversity leads to greater profits 1 . By hiring the right person for the right position, you'' have them stay longer, enhance team culture, and help challenge and grow the organisation. Let's get stuck into how to hire the right person. 1. Educate yourself, and the interviewers What are your hiring principles When hiring, you're looking to hire the best candidate\u2014one who elevates the company and adds to its culture. To do that, everyone involved in hiring needs to be aligned on a core set of hiring principles. When we're misaligned, we tend to hire in our own image, with the short-term in mind, and/or people who don't meet our hiring standards. Hiring principles helps bring speed, quality, diversity, and an exceptional candidate experience to the hiring process. These principles define who you are as a company, how you aim to interview candidates, and how you decide on who to hire. Before interviewing candidates, it's important to read and understand these principles. Who we are Our hiring standards are high. We hire people from diverse backgrounds who will add to our culture. We don\u2019t hire brilliant candidates who are arrogant and dismissive of others\u2019 points of view. How we interview We know the best talent requires engaged hiring managers and interviewers. Hiring managers select great interviewing teams and align interviewers on hiring role expectations and requirements. Interviewers use clearly defined hiring criteria and assigned focus areas to consistently and fairly evaluate candidates. We evaluate candidates using evidence of performance, not pedigree, to predict success. Every interviewee goes through a fair and consistent interviewing process. We treat all candidates the way we\u2019d treat our customers. How we make decisions We take smart risks on candidates. We make quality, consultative hiring decisions, quickly. You can view the expanded principles in Hiring Principles . What makes someone join and stay at a company Your mission, a.k.a. the \"why\" \u2013 Engineers want to make useful things. They want to believe in a company or team's mission. It's enriching and motivating to serve humanity. The team \u2013 Having inspiring peers is a huge motivator for great engineers. These engineers want to learn from others and, in turn, share their knowledge. Adding to this \u2013 If you're a top candidate in an underrepresented group, would you stay at a company who doesn't hire more people like you? The technical problem \u2013 Having some difficult problems to solve is the third main reason great talent will want to work for you. Good engineers want something they can sink their teeth into\u2014like creating something new or scaling up existing services. Assuming compensation is fair, focusing on compensation above Mission, Team and Technical Problem might attract those with the wrong motivations. 2 2. Define the need For each new position, you will want to answer a series of questions in order to better understand the hard requirements of the role and what core values are most important for it. Even though you might be backfilling someone, it's significant to recognise that the needs of the role might have adjusted since it was first filled. Investing time upfront will help you filter for the right types of candidates and find a better fit at the end of the process. Complete the Alignment Guide The alignment guide is the heart of this hiring guide. Complete the template and we'll use it to: Build out our job description Plan out interview questions Gain alignment with recruiting and the interviewers on expectations of the role Write the job description Pulling in details from your completed alignment guide, let's build out the job description. Remember that we want to be hiring a variety of candidates as part of building a strongly-performing team. Some language used, or content omitted, might exclude candidates. In general: Avoid gender-coded words. Pass your completed document through a gender decoder for job descriptions . Limit your job requirements to the \u201cmust-haves\u201d from your alignment guide. By not being truthful with your requirements, you're actually introducing bias. Men apply for jobs when they only meet 60% of its requirements, but women only apply when they meet 100% 3 . Avoid using unnecessary corporate speak and jargon. This kind of language is a barrier keeping talented young people from entry-level positions 4 . Call out inclusive benefits like parental leave and childcare subsidies. It's not a critical step, but including some benefits speaks to your company's larger values of inclusion. Remember what attracts and retains great employees: Mission, Team, and challenging Problems. When writing a job description, we're not just trying to narrow our applicants to those with the right qualifications\u2014we're also trying to attract those qualified applicants. With all that to consider, here's a job description template , and example . 3. Share the job Even though you've nailed the job description, make sure your recruiter is bought into the vision of the role and understands the must-haves you've defined. Furthermore, you'll want to be explicit with them about your diversity goals, and call out any specific diversity boards you want this posted to. This guide isn't going to go into specific sourcing best-practices, but at its core, an engaged hiring manager is more successful than a passive one . Share the job posting with your networks, reach out to old contacts and likely candidates, and engage with people who show interest in the role. Get your team engaged in sharing the role too! 4. Interviewing Overview What does a good experience look like for a candidate? Process : Clearly defined (no surprises); the interview was conversational (not overly stressful); interviewers were engaged. Company and Team : Everyone seemed excited to be working there, and to meet the candidate; company values were demonstrated in the interview. The Job : The candidate got realistic expectations of the job; the mission is clear; any questions were answered satisfactorily. The alignment guide you filled out at the beginning is the central tool used in making sure your candidates have a good experience. It contains prompts for: what a typical day is going to be; what \"success\" is in this role; what experience they need ; what values you want to check for. Realistically, you'll probably be reusing the base technical plans you have for similar roles (engineering, managerial, product, etc.), but don't forget to tweak them for your role. What I want to stress here is the overall alignment with your interviewers! Before kicking off the process, pre-brief with all interviewers. Share with them the alignment guide and make it clear to them your needs and desired traits. After each interview, debrief with the interviewers. This is not only a chance to rate the candidate, but to also reflect on each interview process and whether the candidate should've made it this far. Here's a more in-depth interviewing guide . 5. The end is just the beginning (a.k.a. don't forget about them before they start) 1. Pre-onboarding Don't forget about them once they've signed an offer letter. If the candidate isn't starting for a month or so, we want them to feel confident they've made the right decision. Here are a few ideas to make them excited to join your team: Offer them congratulations, and encourage your team to send them personalised welcome emails. If you have any extra information on your company/organisation/team, now's a good time to send it through. Encourage them to ask questions, and offer to set them up on the product so they can get familiar with it. Two weeks before their start date Check in\u2014see if they have questions, and reiterate that you're looking forward to them joining. Now's a good time to give them an overview of their first couple of weeks. One or two days before they start, make sure that you have everything lined up for their arrival: desk (if not remote), access to repositories, company login, company swag. 2. Define what their onboarding experience will look like How are you going to introduce them to all the features they'll own? Can you give them a walkthrough of the product? Do you know how to onboard them to all the new systems, and codebases they'll be touching? Who should they meet while onboarding? Have you picked out a mentor for them? What are some good onboarding bug tickets to ramp them up? What will their first major project be? Here's a more in-depth onboarding guide . Next steps How do we define and measure success? This hiring guide does not yet reflect on what hires we've made and how they stack up to our hiring goals. This is something that should be covered in the future.

Remember that we want to be hiring a variety of candidates as part of building a strongly-performing team. Some language used, or content omitted, might exclude candidates. In general: Avoid gender-coded words. Pass your completed document through a gender decoder for job descriptions . Limit your job requirements to the \u201cmust-haves\u201d from your alignment guide. By not being truthful with your requirements, you're actually introducing bias. Men apply for jobs when they only meet 60% of its requirements, but women only apply when they meet 100% 3 . Avoid using unnecessary corporate speak and jargon. This kind of language is a barrier keeping talented young people from entry-level positions 4 . Call out inclusive benefits like parental leave and childcare subsidies. It's not a critical step, but including some benefits speaks to your company's larger values of inclusion.

Process : Clearly defined (no surprises); the interview was conversational (not overly stressful); interviewers were engaged. Company and Team : Everyone seemed excited to be working there, and to meet the candidate; company values were demonstrated in the interview. The Job : The candidate got realistic expectations of the job; the mission is clear; any questions were answered satisfactorily. The alignment guide you filled out at the beginning is the central tool used in making sure your candidates have a good experience. It contains prompts for: what a typical day is going to be; what \"success\" is in this role; what experience they need ; what values you want to check for. Realistically, you'll probably be reusing the base technical plans you have for similar roles (engineering, managerial, product, etc.), but don't forget to tweak them for your role. What I want to stress here is the overall alignment with your interviewers! Before kicking off the process, pre-brief with all interviewers. Share with them the alignment guide and make it clear to them your needs and desired traits. After each interview, debrief with the interviewers. This is not only a chance to rate the candidate, but to also reflect on each interview process and whether the candidate should've made it this far.

I am also not certain of how impactful this is compared to just following the hiring alignment guide. This is something I want to hear more opinions on, and will explore more in the future. Who we are Our hiring standards are high. We want our hiring standards to go up\u2014not down\u2014over time. We would rather leave a role open longer than fill it with someone who is not a great fit. We hire people from diverse backgrounds who will add to our culture. We actively seek to recruit a diverse pool of candidates from different backgrounds\u2014human diversity (ethnicity, gender, religion, age, etc.) and cultural/cognitive diversity (learning styles, education, work experiences, geographies, points of view, etc.). We are inclusive and collaborative, and we view diversity an addition to our company that will help us to deliver better products and customer experiences. We avoid using terms like \u201cculture fit\u201d and instead prefer that interviewers identify specific behavioural evidence when evaluating a candidate\u2019s non-technical/non-functional capabilities. We don\u2019t hire candidates who are arrogant and dismissive of others\u2019 points of view, even if we think they\u2019re smart and capable. No assholes. Although someone might be brilliant, they need to operate within a team. Everyone needs to trust each other and feel safe offering differences of opinion. Big ego candidates unwilling to listen and collaborate ruin teams and repel top talent. But, we do want people who will challenge us (respectfully) and demonstrate courage by speaking up. How we interview We know the best talent requires engaged hiring managers and interviewers. Hiring managers who hire top talent invest heavily in recruiting and partner effectively with recruiting. Passive hiring managers hire less qualified talent than active, engaged, \u201calways-be-recruiting\u201d hiring managers. Good hiring managers are accountable leaders of the process who drive alignment with their interviewing team and recruiter to ensure everyone is clear on hiring criteria, hiring principles, interviewing process, role expectations, selling the opportunity, meeting service level agreements with recruiters, and sharing evidence-based interview feedback. The hiring manager\u2019s job doesn't end on the start date\u2014they must ensure an onboarding plan is built before the new hire\u2019s first day. Hiring managers select great interviewing teams and align interviewers to hiring role expectations and requirements. Interview team composition impacts who we hire and the candidate experience we create. We select interviewers based on their skills as interviewers and relevancy to the work/job. Our interviewers should represent the diversity and inclusion we seek\u2014different backgrounds, styles, ethnicities, genders, etc. You're more likely to recruit candidates from different backgrounds if they see themselves represented in the interviewing team. Interviewers use clearly defined hiring criteria and assigned focus areas to consistently and fairly evaluate candidates. We want to hire people we can get along with, but hiring based on gut feeling, hiring someone you can be friends with, and interviewing for \"personality\" introduces biases into the process. This usually leads to a more homogeneous workplace that lacks diversity. We evaluate candidates using evidence of performance, not pedigree, to predict success. We interview in alignment with our values, using evidence-based behavioural and situational interviewing. We evaluate a candidate against two key areas: The \"What\": skills and knowledge, technical/functional abilities and achievements and The \"How\": behaviours and motivators that can predict on-the-job-success. Every interviewee goes through a fair and consistent interviewing process. No exemptions for referrals or internals. Candidates should describe our interviews as consistent, fair, and deep, and our interviewers as smart, friendly, authentic, and prepared. We treat all candidates the way we\u2019d treat our customers. Top candidates are interviewing us as much as we\u2019re interviewing them, and our employment brand\u2014our reputation as an employer\u2014is built one candidate interaction at a time. We want every candidate to receive an exceptionally positive experience! Selling is everyone\u2019s job, and every candidate deserves a great experience and a realistic job preview, whether they are hired or not. How we make decisions We take smart risks on candidates. Candidates do not need to be perfect to be hired; every hire involves some risk. We don't take risks on candidates who aren't aligned with our behaviours and values. We believe in the growth-mindset. When making a trade-off, we take risks on people who need help developing technical skills or gaining experiences that are easily obtained on-the-job; these are teachable. We make quality, consultative hiring decisions, quickly. Consensus is not required\u2014ultimately, the hiring manager makes the final decision with input from the interviewers. Closed or anonymous feedback decision-making processes open the door for bias and discrimination. We conduct live discussion debriefs to make hiring decisions so that interviewers can calibrate and learn from each other\u2019s feedback. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s job to ensure we make fair, quality hiring decisions, so if we see bias or discrimination, we say something.
