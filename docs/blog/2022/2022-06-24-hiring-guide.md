Love or hate it, hiring is an integral part of a manager's role. As a new manager, my bosses never made a point to teach better hiring practices. In the past, I've pieced together company interview questions and rubrics interview plans, but I wanted to create a holistic guide. I wanted to outline the “why's” as well as the “how's”—something I would’ve found useful when I first became a manager.

[Here’s the hiring guide](https://www.nikmoores.com/wiki/hiring-guide) .

I recently completed a hiring bootcamp training, which has helped me reinvigorate my interest in hiring. This hiring guide pulls in a lot of practical advice from the multi-day training, as well as other things I've picked up along the way. 
I like the distinction between hiring and interviewing—interviewing is only a subset of the hiring process. Successful hiring starts with taking a step back and asking yourself key questions about the role—not just posting the same iOS/backend/web role all over again. Onboarding is also something I consider to be an integral part of the hiring process (don’t hamstring new hires by not helping them integrate with the team). I’ll be fleshing out these interviewing and onboarding guides in the future.
It’s still early days using it, but I’ve found the alignment guide to have the right framing questions to make writing the job description, and building the interview plan, more accurate to what your team actually needs.

I’m sure I’ll find ways to improve the guide as I learn more, but this is a strong foundation.
