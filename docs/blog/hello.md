This simple (and quite niche) wiki is something I've been wanting to build for a while. 
Like a lot of newly minted managers, I relied heavily on verbal guidance, as documentation on best practices was sparsely available. I wanted something better than that.

I'm a fan of building playbooks for new processes:
1. work through a hard problem while documenting the steps
2. on the next run through just plug the gaps
3. by the third pass it's pretty straightforward and you have a template in place!
However, all good processes are flexible and adapt over time. They should change as your philosophies, your team, and the org definitely will. 

This is how I've been writing items for the toolkit. I intend to continue to update it based what I'm learning and who I'm working with. In that same spirit it should also be explicitly stated that the goal of the wiki isn't to be prescriptive for managers—you'll have different philosophies, different team norms, different cultures, etc.—it's a starting point for a *conversation*. If this doesn't make sense for your team, think about *why* it doesn't work and what you would do differently.

My intention for this toolkit is for it to cover everything a manager should be thinking about. We've all got knowledge gaps so a toolkit like this can only be complete if we share and learn from others. This a public GitHub repo so anyone can submit pull requests to help flesh it out. Likewise you can fork the repository and build something for yourself or your team (the only request is that you keep it public, to share your ideas).

See you in there!
