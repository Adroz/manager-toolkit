G'day, I'm Nik. I'm a manager of engineering managers at Autodesk.

This website aims to serve as my managing toolkit â€” a bag of ideas, philosophies and templates that help me get up and running when setting up a team, or share concepts with a new manager. Some concepts are largely my own, some have come largely from others. Some a new ideas, some are tried and tested. There's a lot of gaps, but I'm hoping to keep adding, learning, and iterating.
