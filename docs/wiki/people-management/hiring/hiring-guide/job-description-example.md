# Job Description Example

### About Autodesk Construction
Construction remains one of the [least digitised industries](https://www.globalinfrastructureinitiative.com/sites/default/files/pdf/The-digital-future-of-construction-Oct-2016.pdf), and productivity has remained [mainly flat](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-construction-productivity-imperative) over the last 30 years. This leads to longer working hours, cost overruns, and scheduling delays. Our customers are constructing some of the largest projects worldwide, and they rely on us to develop intuitive, scalable, and flexible tools.

On the Progress Tracking team, we’re making it easier than ever to stay on schedule and on budget by building a tool that helps our users accurately track work status on the jobsite. Without our tool, construction teams spend dozens of hours per week filling out forms, consolidating spreadsheets, and marking up plans. As a member of the team, you’ll be [helping our customers easily track, monitor, and report on their work with only a few clicks](https://construction.autodesk.com/tools/beta-progress-tracking/?wvideo=9ihibrzfoj).
