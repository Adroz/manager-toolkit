# Job Description Template
### About [company and team]
*You want candidates to be excited about your company and the transformation happening in the industry. Write about what your company is doing within the larger industry, how technology enables that, and where your team/org fits. Answer the question, "How does this role contribute to making people’s lives better or solve existing business or social problems?"*

*If you have any education material about your product space (such as a product walk-through), now's a good time to link it.*

*Realistically, this section will probably be the same for all the roles you post, but don't forget to look out for changes in culture or mission since your last posting.*

!!! example
	"Welcome to [company]! We are looking for enthusiastic, passionate members to join our team. Here at [company] we believe in creating innovations that will benefit our immediate community, and beyond. For years, our company has strived to provide the best prices possible without abandoning quality and care. This is your opportunity to join the [company] team and leave your mark on our company, on the [industry] and on the world at large."

### What does a day as a [job role] look like for you?
*From the [Alignment Guide](alignment-guide-template) you filled out, what are they going to be working on? We can't cover all the minutia of their day, but we can ideally give them a good overview that aligns with what they'll *actually* work on, and also sell them on the technical challenges they'll face.* 

*Keep this both realistic and succinct.*

*Describe the key job functions in five to seven bullets. If it's helpful, you also can group two to three bullets under larger categories, such as "Technical Skills," "Management Skills," "Communication," and the like.*

*Finally, consider telling a story of what their impact looks like after accepting the role. This makes it easier to see themselves in the position.*

!!! example
	"After 30 days in your role as (job title) you will have accomplished [deliverable 1 for first month, deliverable 2]. This is your opportunity to collaborate with experts in your field and increase your scope of knowledge in the [industry] with an industry leader. If you want to be on the front lines of change in your industry and have access to cutting edge tools and techniques, then this role will be perfect for you and your career."

### Requirements
*Now that they're interested, we should exclude those who don't meet our "must haves." From your alignment guide, what were your hard requirements for the role?*

### Diversity
*Talk about your diversity efforts directly. How committed are you to hiring underrepresented candidates? How do you make sure they feel heard and included?*

### More about us
*Team and culture is a big part of what makes an organisation competitive into today's job market. Candidates ultimately ask themselves, "Will I be a good fit and really enjoy working here?", so it's key to sell here.*
	
*You want the reader to quickly understand your values, get a feel for the culture, and gain insight into your company benefits. As with everything, be truthful—don't boast about some perks that aren't realistic.*
